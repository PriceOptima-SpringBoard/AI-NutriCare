# Milestone 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing

This milestone focuses on understanding the dataset and preparing it for
machine learning model development.

---

## Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset
- Identify data quality issues
- Perform necessary preprocessing
- Prepare clean data for model training

---

## Dataset Exploration
- Dataset was loaded and inspected using `head()`, `info()`, and `describe()`
- Structure, data types, and basic statistics were analyzed
- Missing values and inconsistencies were identified

---

## Data Preprocessing
- Missing values were handled appropriately
- Duplicate records were checked and addressed
- Data was cleaned to ensure consistency and usability
- Dataset was transformed into a machine-learning-ready format

---

## Exploratory Analysis
- Basic inspection helped understand feature behavior
- Insights from analysis guided feature preparation

---

## Feature Preparation
- Relevant input features were selected
- Target variable was separated
- Final dataset prepared for model training in Milestone 2

---

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas,NumPy,Matplot,Seaborn
- VS code

---

## Output
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Saved two dynamic datasets X.npy and Y.npy which are input for Milestone-2.

---

## Conclusion
All data collection, exploration, and preprocessing tasks were successfully
completed. The dataset is now ready for machine learning model development.
