# AI/ML-Based Personalized Diet Plan Generator

AI-NutriCare is an intelligent healthcare application that analyzes medical reports to generate personalized diet plans tailored to an individual’s health profile. 
The system uses AI, Machine Learning, NLP, and OCR to extract numeric health metrics (such as blood sugar, cholesterol, BMI) and interpret doctor’s notes from PDFs, text files, or scanned reports. 
Based on detected medical conditions, dietary preferences, and allergies, it automatically recommends balanced, condition-aware diet plans and exports them in user-friendly formats like PDF.

# Problem
Patients often struggle to interpret their medical reports and adjust their diet accordingly. Generic diet recommendations do not account for individual health conditions, leading to ineffective or potentially harmful guidance. 
AI-NutriCare bridges this gap by providing a personalized, data-driven diet plan that adapts to the patient’s medical context.
