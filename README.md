# 🧠 AI-NutriCare  
## AI/ML-Powered Personalized Diet Plan Generator  

**AI-NutriCare** is an intelligent, AI/ML-driven platform that generates **personalized diet plans** by analyzing comprehensive patient medical data — including **numeric lab measurements, doctor prescriptions, and textual clinical notes**.  
Unlike traditional diet suggestions, **AI-NutriCare** creates tailored nutrition plans that consider each individual’s **health conditions, allergies, and food preferences**, delivering accurate and actionable dietary recommendations.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  

AI-NutriCare integrates **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to process both **structured** (e.g., lab values, vitals) and **unstructured** (e.g., doctor notes) medical data.  
By leveraging **time-series data** from medical histories, the system identifies meaningful trends in a patient’s health parameters and generates **optimized diet recommendations** aligned with medical needs.

## 💡 Problem Statement  

Interpreting complex medical reports and translating them into daily nutrition choices is often challenging for patients.  
Most existing diet plans are **generic** and **ignore the individual’s medical background**, which can lead to **ineffective or even harmful dietary outcomes**.  

**AI-NutriCare** addresses this challenge by:  
- Automatically analyzing and interpreting medical reports using AI/ML models.  
- Extracting key health and nutritional insights from clinical data.  
- Delivering customized diet plans designed around personal medical and lifestyle factors.
