### AI/ML-Based Personalized Diet Plan Generator
AI-NutriCare is an AI/ML-driven platform that analyzes patient medical reports—including numeric measurements and textual doctor notes/prescriptions—and generates personalized diet plans.
Unlike generic diet suggestions, this system considers individual health conditions, allergies, and dietary preferences to provide actionable nutrition guidance.

The platform leverages time-series patient data, lab results, vitals, and medications, applying advanced AI/ML and NLP models to extract meaningful patterns and optimize diet recommendations.
