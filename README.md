# 🎯AI-NutriCare

AI-NutriCare is an AI/ML-based project designed to help people understand their medical reports better. It analyzes important health values such as glucose, cholesterol, and BMI to identify possible health conditions and suggest personalized diet plans.

The system processes medical data, applies a basic machine-learning model, and uses simple NLP techniques to understand doctor notes. Based on this analysis, it generates clear and easy-to-follow diet recommendations that support healthier lifestyle choices.
