# Milestone-2: LSTM Model Training 

## Overview
This milestone focuses on **building and training a deep learning model (LSTM)** to learn patterns from **sequential nutrition and health data** for the AI-NutriCare system.

---

## Objective
- Train an **LSTM-based model** using preprocessed data from Milestone-1  
- Capture **time-dependent health patterns**
- Save the trained model for prediction in Milestone-3

---

## Approach
1. Load preprocessed nutrition and health dataset  
2. Select features and target variable  
3. Normalize input data for stable training  
4. Create time-based sequences for LSTM  
5. Train the LSTM model  
6. Evaluate model performance  
7. Save the trained model for inference

---

## Model Used
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- Suitable for **sequential and time-series data**
- Helps retain long-term dependencies in nutrition patterns

---

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## Output
- Trained LSTM model (`.h5` file)
- Model evaluation metrics
- Model ready for prediction in Milestone-3

---

## Key Learning
- Handling sequential data using LSTM
- End-to-end deep learning training pipeline
- Model evaluation and persistence
