# AI-ML Based Personalized Diet Plan Generator
## Milestone-1
This milestone focuses on data collection, preprocessing, and dynamic time-series dataset creation from medical and ICU data. The output is a structured dataset ready for AI/ML modeling.

### Key Objectives:
- [x] Collect and merge patient medical data from multiple sources (ICU vitals, lab results, fluid balance, prescriptions).
- [x] Preprocess numeric and textual data into a standardized 24-hour time-series format.
- [x] Create medication class indicators for key drug classes.
- [x] Compute fluid balance (input - output).
- [x] Merge all features into a combined dataset (X) for ML.
- [x] Extract patient outcome labels (y) for mortality prediction.
- [x] Save the processed dataset for downstream modeling.
